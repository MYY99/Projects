# Investigating the Performance of a Capsule Network in Digit Classification Task
Hinton et al. [5] and Sabour et al. [6] presented capsule network with dynamic routing, an approach closer to replicating the human vision, to resolve the fundamental limitations of CNNs: translational equivariance [1], no build-in understanding of 3D space, and Picasso problem [2]. 

This project investigates the performance of a Capsule Network (CapsNet) in digit classification task.
