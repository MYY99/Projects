# A Smart Door System
This project aims to design a smart door system that can be used to detect presence and authenticate the personnel that want to enter the protected premise. The system should have several key features: 
1) IoT Sensor and Network System to Gain Access
2) Machine Learning System for Movement Detection
3) Temperature and Humidity Detection
4) Physical Security Door Lock
5) Security â€“ Encryption and Decryption Algorithm
Take note that only the basic functionalities of these features are described, and additional modifications must be implemented according to the marking rubric to obtain higher grades.
