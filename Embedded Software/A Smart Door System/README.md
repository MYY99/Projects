# A Smart Door System
## Built with
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Raspberry Pi
## Achievements
- Developed an IoT-based smart door access control system using Raspberry Pi computers, along with a camera and ultrasonic sensors
- Implemented MLPs for movement detection, achieving a validation accuracy of 97%, and weather classification using sklearn

## Description
This project aims to design a smart door system that can be used to detect presence and authenticate the personnel that want to enter the protected premise. The system has several key features: 
1) IoT Sensor and Network System to Gain Access
2) Machine Learning System for Movement Detection
3) Temperature and Humidity Detection
4) Physical Security Door Lock
5) Security – Encryption and Decryption Algorithm
6) Database management and door access system


## Prototype
Please don't mind the ugly prototype... We rushed it out for demonstration purpose only (aesthetics and tidiness put aside for a moment :D).
